# 🐍 Python Fundamentals Practice Project

## 📘 Overview  
This project focuses on strengthening fundamental Python programming skills through practical exercises. It covers numeric operations, user input handling, and formatted output. Completing this project helped me develop the ability to manipulate numbers, perform calculations,report results clearly.Identify and resolve simple arithmetic errors independently in Python.

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

### 🔢 Digit Extraction and Manipulation  
Extract digits from numbers using **floor division (`//`)** and **modulus (`%`)** to sum or reverse digits.
